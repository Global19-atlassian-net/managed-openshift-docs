= Understanding the {product-title} architecture

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} is an enterprise Kubernetes platform for developing and running containerized applications. {product-title} is dedicated to a single customer, professionally managed by Red Hat, and hosted on AWS or Google Cloud. Each OpenShift Dedicated cluster comes with a fully managed control plane (Master and Infrastructure nodes), application nodes, installation and management by Red Hat Site Reliability Engineers (SRE), premium Red Hat Support, and cluster services such as logging, metrics, monitoring, notifications portal, and cluster portal.

== What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The general concept of Kubernetes is fairly simple:

- Start with one or more worker nodes to run the container workloads.
- Manage the deployment of those workloads from one or more master nodes.
- Wrap containers in a deployment unit called a Pod. Using Pods provides extra metadata with the container and offers the ability to group several containers in a single deployment entity.
- Create special kinds of assets. For example, services are represented by a set of Pods and a policy that defines how they are accessed. This policy allows containers to connect to the services that they need even if they do not have the specific IP addresses for the services. Replication controllers are another special asset that indicates how many Pod Replicas are required to run at a time. You can use this capability to automatically scale your application to adapt to its current demand.

== What are containers?
Containers provide a standard way to package your application's code, configurations, and dependencies into a single unit that can run as a resource-isolated process on a compute server. To run your app in Kubernetes on {product-title}, you must first containerize your app by creating a container image that you store in a container registry.
